  <h1>KISS File Transfer Protocol: Detailed Documentation</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>KISS File Transfer Protocol</strong> is a robust suite of applications designed for reliable file transfer over RF with any KISS compatible TNC and uses standard AX.25 UI frames (i.e. does not require 'connected mode'). The system consists of a sender, receiver and optional fileserver applications, as well as dedicated applications for repeating and bridging. A pure HTML/JS implementation is provided with support for Chrome's Serial API as well as an optional websockets application. The protocol divides a file into a header packet containing metadata and multiple data packets carrying file chunks. It also supports control packets including ACKs (acknowledgments) and command (CMD) and response (RSP) messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The protocol supports both raw binary and Base64-encoded payloads, optional zlib compression, and a dynamic sliding window with adaptive timeouts and retransmissions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Core Protocol Components</h2>
    <p>
      The protocol defines several key packet types:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DATA Packets:</strong> Transmit file data, including a header packet that carries metadata.</li>
        <li><strong>ACK Packets:</strong> Provide cumulative acknowledgments to control retransmissions and window advancement.</li>
        <li><strong>CMD Packets:</strong> Issued by remote clients to request operations such as GET, LIST, and PUT.</li>
        <li><strong>RSP Packets:</strong> Server responses to CMD packets, indicating the result of the requested operation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, each packet includes explicit fields such as a unique <code>FILEID</code>, encoding method (0 for binary, 1 for Base64), and a compression flag.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>KISS Framing and AX.25 Header</h2>

    <h3>KISS Framing</h3>
    <p>
      All packets are encapsulated in a KISS frame to preserve data boundaries. The process is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start Flag:</strong> A byte <code>0xC0</code> marks the beginning of a frame.</li>
      <li><strong>Command Byte:</strong> Immediately follows the start flag; typically set to <code>0x00</code> for data packets.</li>
      <li><strong>Escaping:</strong> Special bytes (<code>0xC0</code> and <code>0xDB</code>) within the payload are replaced with escape sequences to prevent conflicts with framing markers.</li>
      <li><strong>End Flag:</strong> A closing <code>0xC0</code> byte signals the end of the frame.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
function buildKISSFrame(packet):
    FLAG = 0xC0
    CMD  = 0x00
    escaped_packet = escapeSpecialBytes(packet)
    return FLAG + CMD + escaped_packet + FLAG
    </pre>

    <h3>AX.25 Header</h3>
    <p>
      Each packet begins with a fixed 16-byte header modeled after AX.25 addressing. This header includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Destination Callsign (7 bytes):</strong> The recipient’s callsign, converted to uppercase, padded or truncated to 6 characters, with the 7th byte encoding the SSID and a “last address” flag.</li>
      <li><strong>Source Callsign (7 bytes):</strong> The sender’s callsign, formatted similarly, with the “last” flag set.</li>
      <li><strong>Control and PID (2 bytes):</strong> Typically the bytes <code>0x03</code> and <code>0xF0</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
function buildAX25Header(source, destination):
    dest = encodeAddress(destination, is_last = False)
    src  = encodeAddress(source, is_last = True)
    CONTROL = 0x03
    PID     = 0xF0
    return dest + src + CONTROL + PID
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Packet Formats and Fields</h2>

    <h3>Common Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Every packet consists of:
      <ul>
        <li>The KISS frame wrapping the packet.</li>
        <li>An AX.25 header for addressing.</li>
        <li>An <strong>info field</strong> whose content varies based on the packet type.</li>
        <li>A <strong>payload</strong> containing file data, metadata, or control information.</li>
        <li>Explicit protocol fields such as <code>FILEID</code>, <code>encodingMethod</code>, and <code>compress_flag</code>.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>DATA Packets</h3>
    <p>
      DATA packets are used to transmit file data. They come in two types:
    </p>

    <h4>Header Packet (Sequence 1)</h4>
    <p>
      The header packet initializes a file transfer and carries vital metadata. Its info field is formatted as:
    </p>
    <pre>
"FILEID:0001{burst_to_hex}/{total_hex}:"
    </pre>
    <p>
      Where:
      <ul>
        <li><code>FILEID</code> is the unique file identifier.</li>
        <li><code>0001</code> indicates that this is the header packet.</li>
        <li><code>{burst_to_hex}</code> is the burst boundary expressed in 4-digit hexadecimal.</li>
        <li><code>{total_hex}</code> is the total number of data packets (also in 4-digit hexadecimal).</li>
      </ul>
      Following this, the header payload is a UTF‑8 pipe‑delimited string containing:
      <ul>
        <li>Timeout seconds and retry count</li>
        <li>Filename</li>
        <li>Original file size and compressed file size</li>
        <li>MD5 checksum</li>
        <li>The file identifier (repeated)</li>
        <li>Encoding method (0 for binary, 1 for Base64)</li>
        <li>Compression flag (1 if compressed, 0 otherwise)</li>
        <li>Total packet count (header + data packets)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Data Packets (Sequence ≥ 2)</h4>
    <p>
      Data packets carry sequential chunks of file data. Their info field is formatted as:
    </p>
    <pre>
"FILEID:{seq_hex}{burst_to_hex}:"
    </pre>
    <p>
      Where:
      <ul>
        <li><code>{seq_hex}</code> is the 4-digit hexadecimal sequence number (starting from 0002).</li>
        <li><code>{burst_to_hex}</code> indicates the burst boundary for the current window.</li>
      </ul>
      The payload following this info field is a chunk of file data (up to a configured <code>CHUNK_SIZE</code> in bytes). If Base64 encoding is enabled, each chunk is individually encoded.
    </p>

    <h3>ACK Packets</h3>
    <p>
      ACK packets acknowledge received data. Their info field contains fields separated by colons. A cumulative ACK, for example <code>"FILEID:ACK:0001-XXXX"</code>, indicates the highest contiguous packet received.
    </p>

    <h3>CMD and RSP Packets</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>CMD Packets:</strong> Issued by remote clients, CMD packets enable file operations (such as GET, LIST, or PUT). Their info field is constructed as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
"cmdID:CMD:<command text>"
    </pre>
    <p>
      In this format:
      <ul>
        <li><code>cmdID</code> is a two-character command identifier generated for the command.</li>
        <li><code>CMD</code> is the literal string indicating a command.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;command text&gt;</code> is the operation to be performed (for example, “GET myfile.txt”, “LIST”, or “PUT myfile.txt”).</li>
      </ul>
      This colon-separated format permits variable-length command messages without padding.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>RSP Packets:</strong> Sent in response to CMD packets, RSP packets provide the result of the requested operation. Their info field is formatted as:
    </p>
    <pre>
"cmdID:RSP:<status>:<message>"
    </pre>
    <p>
      Here:
      <ul>
        <li><code>cmdID</code> is the two-character identifier corresponding to the original CMD packet.</li>
        <li><code>RSP</code> is the literal string indicating a response.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;status&gt;</code> is an integer value where <code>1</code> denotes success and <code>0</code> denotes failure.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;message&gt;</code> is a brief description of the outcome.</li>
      </ul>
      The colon delimiters clearly separate each field, facilitating straightforward parsing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Receiver Operation and File Reassembly</h2>
    <p>
      The receiver processes incoming KISS frames via a <code>FrameReader</code>, parses packets, and reassembles file transfers. Key steps include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frame Reading and Packet Extraction:</strong> Data is read from the connection, unescaped, and divided into complete KISS frames.</li>
      <li><strong>Packet Parsing:</strong> The receiver distinguishes between ACK packets, CMD/RSP packets, and data packets. Header packets (sequence 1) initialize a new transfer, while subsequent packets (sequence ≥ 2) are stored in a map keyed by sequence number.</li>
      <li><strong>File Reassembly:</strong> Once all expected packets are received, the receiver:
        <ul>
          <li>Orders the data packets by sequence number.</li>
          <li>Decodes Base64 payloads if required.</li>
          <li>Decompresses the file if compression was applied.</li>
          <li>Verifies the file’s integrity using an MD5 checksum.</li>
          <li>Finally, the file is either saved, output, or executed according to configuration.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>ACK and Retransmission:</strong> The receiver computes cumulative ACKs based on the highest contiguous sequence number received and periodically retransmits ACKs if data is delayed, until a final confirmation (FIN‑ACK) is received.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pseudocode: Receiver Main Loop</h3>
    <pre>
// Initialize connection and frame reader
conn = openConnection()         // TCP or serial
frameChan = newChannel()
reader = new FrameReader(conn, frameChan)
start(reader.Run())

transfers = {}   // Map FILEID -> Transfer state

while true:
    if frame received from frameChan:
        packet = parsePacket(frame)
        if packet is ACK:
            continue
        if no transfer exists for packet.FILEID:
            if packet.seq != 1:
                continue
            metadata = split(packet.payload, "|")
            transfers[packet.FILEID] = new Transfer(
                filename = metadata[2],
                origSize = metadata[3],
                compSize = metadata[4],
                md5 = metadata[5],
                encodingMethod = metadata[7],
                compress = (metadata[8] == "1"),
                totalPackets = metadata[9]
            )
            sendAck(conn, localCallsign, packet.sender, packet.FILEID, "0001")
        else:
            transfer = transfers[packet.FILEID]
            if packet.seq == 1:
                continue
            if packet.seq not in transfer.Packets:
                transfer.Packets[packet.seq] = packet.payload
            if packet.seq equals transfer.BurstTo:
                ackValue = computeCumulativeAck(transfer)
                sendAck(conn, localCallsign, packet.sender, packet.FILEID, ackValue)
    else if timeout:
        for each transfer in transfers:
            if inactivity exceeds retry interval:
                if retries not exceeded:
                    resend cumulative ACK for transfer
                else:
                    drop transfer
    for each transfer in transfers:
        if all expected packets received:
            fileData = concatenate packets in order
            if encodingMethod == 1:
                fileData = base64Decode(fileData)
            if compress:
                fileData = decompress(fileData)
            if md5(fileData) matches transfer.md5:
                processFile(fileData, transfer.filename)
            send final ACK (FIN-ACK)
            remove transfer from transfers
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>TCP Inactivity and Reconnection (Receiver)</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure robustness, the receiver monitors TCP inactivity. If no data is received within a configured deadline, the receiver reconnects.
    </p>
    <h3>Pseudocode: TCP Inactivity Monitor</h3>
    <pre>
tcp_timeout = configured deadline (e.g., 600 seconds)
while true:
    sleep(1 second)
    if currentTime - lastDataTime > tcp_timeout:
        log "Inactivity detected, reconnecting..."
        reader.Stop()
        conn.Close()
        loop until new connection is established:
            wait 5 seconds
            attempt new connection
        update lastDataTime
        restart FrameReader with new connection
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Dynamic Sliding Window and ACK Retransmission</h2>
    <p>
      The sender implements a dynamic sliding window, while the receiver computes a cumulative ACK based on the highest contiguous packet received and retransmits ACKs if necessary.
    </p>
    <pre>
function computeCumulativeAck(transfer):
    max_seq = 1
    for seq = 2 to transfer.totalPackets:
        if transfer.Packets contains seq:
            max_seq = seq
        else:
            break
    if max_seq == 1:
        return "0001"
    else:
        return "0001-" + toHex(max_seq, 4)
    </pre>
    <p>
      The ACK is then sent encapsulated within a KISS frame.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Example Command Line Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The receiver application can be invoked as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h4>Receiver Example</h4>
      <pre>
# Receiver that saves files to disk
./receiver --my-callsign MM3NDH-11 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9001 --one-file --callsigns "MM5NDH-*,*-15"

# Receiver that outputs the received file to stdout (for piping)

    <h2>Summary and Final Remarks</h2>
    <p>
      The KISS File Transfer Protocol combines robust framing (using KISS and AX.25), explicit metadata, and dynamic control mechanisms to enable reliable file transfers in challenging RF environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      With support for DATA, ACK, CMD, and RSP packets, optional zlib compression, and Base64 encoding on a per-chunk basis, the sender and receiver collaborate using dynamic sliding windows, adaptive timeouts, and reconnection logic to maximize throughput while ensuring data integrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      CMD packets follow the format <code>"&lt;cmdID&gt;:CMD:&lt;command text&gt;"</code>, and the corresponding RSP packets use the format <code>"&lt;cmdID&gt;:RSP:&lt;status&gt;:&lt;message&gt;"</code>, where the <code>cmdID</code> links the request and its response.
