  <h1>Passthrough Documentation</h1>
  <p>
    Passthrough is a lightweight bridge application that connects a Terminal Node Controller (TNC) to multiple TCP clients.
    The application can connect to the TNC using either TCP or serial interfaces. Any data received from the TNC is broadcast to all connected clients,
    while data sent by clients is forwarded to the TNC.
  </p>
  <p>
    An optional <code>--send-delay</code> flag introduces a turnaround delay before client data is forwarded to the TNC after a received frame.
    This feature is especially useful for preventing data collisions in environments where precise timing is critical.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, the <code>--tcp-broadcast-port</code> flag allows you to open a dedicated one‑way broadcast port.
    When set, all frames passing through the bridge are also sent out via this port.
    Note that clients connecting to the broadcast port will only receive data – any data sent to this port is ignored.

  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Passthrough application serves as a bidirectional bridge between a TNC device and TCP clients.
    It supports two primary connection methods to the TNC:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>TCP Connection:</strong> Connect to the TNC over TCP using the provided host and port.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Serial Connection:</strong> Connect to the TNC via a serial interface using the specified port and baud rate.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Data received from the TNC is forwarded to all connected TCP clients.
    Similarly, any data received from a client is sent to the TNC.
    If a frame is just received from the TNC, a configurable turnaround delay (using <code>--send-delay</code>)
    is applied before sending new frames from a client to the TNC.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, using the <code>--tcp-broadcast-port</code> option, you can enable a dedicated one‑way broadcast channel.
    All frames passing through the bridge are also sent out on the specified broadcast port.
  </p>

  <h2 id="kiss-framing">KISS Framing</h2>
  <p>
    Passthrough uses the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) protocol for framing data. Each frame is delimited by a special flag byte (<code>0xC0</code>).
    The application extracts complete frames – those that start and end with the flag – and buffers incomplete data until the frame is complete.
  </p>

  <h2 id="installation">Installation &amp; Build</h2>
  <p>
    To build the Passthrough application, ensure that you have <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> installed on your system.
    Then, compile the program using the following command:
  </p>
  <pre>
go build -o passthrough passthrough.go
  </pre>

  <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
  <h3>Example 1: TCP Connection with Default Settings</h3>
  <p>
    Run Passthrough using a TCP connection to the TNC with default host/port options, while listening for client connections on port <code>5010</code>:
  </p>
  <pre>
go run passthrough.go
  </pre>

  <h3>Example 2: Serial Connection to TNC</h3>
  <p>
    In this example, the TNC is accessed via a serial interface (e.g. <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> on Unix or <code>COM3</code> on Windows) at 115200 baud:
  </p>
  <pre>
go run passthrough.go --tnc-connection-type=serial --tnc-serial-port=/dev/ttyUSB0 --tnc-baud=115200
  </pre>

  <h3>Example 3: Enabling a Turnaround Delay</h3>
  <p>
    The following command configures a 100 millisecond delay before sending any client data to the TNC after receiving a frame:
  </p>
  <pre>
go run passthrough.go --send-delay=100
  </pre>

  <h3>Example 4: Setting a Custom TCP Read Deadline</h3>
  <p>
    This command sets a custom TCP read deadline of 300 seconds. If no complete frame is received from the TCP TNC within this time, the connection will be reset:
  </p>
  <pre>
go run passthrough.go --tcp-read-deadline=300
  </pre>

  <h3>Example 5: Enabling the TCP Broadcast Port</h3>
  <p>
    The following command opens a dedicated one‑way broadcast port on <code>7000</code>.
    All frames passing through the bridge are also sent to any clients connected on port <code>7000</code>:
  </p>
  <pre>
go run passthrough.go --tcp-broadcast-port=7000
  </pre>

  <h2 id="notes">Additional Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When using serial connections, ensure you have the proper permissions to access the serial device.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <code>--send-delay</code> flag helps prevent collisions on the TNC interface; however, a high delay value may introduce unwanted latency.
    </li>
    <li>
      Passthrough will continuously attempt to reconnect to the TNC if the connection is lost. Meanwhile, connected TCP clients will continue to receive any available TNC data.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <code>--tcp-read-deadline</code> flag applies only to TCP-based TNC connections.
      If no complete frame is received within the specified time, the connection is considered stalled and a reconnect is triggered.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <code>--tcp-broadcast-port</code> option creates a dedicated one‑way broadcast channel.
      Data sent to this port is not processed; it is strictly for broadcasting frames.
    </li>
    <li>
      All data is framed using the KISS protocol. Only complete frames (those starting and ending with the flag <code>0xC0</code>) are processed; any incomplete frames are buffered until complete.
    </li>
  </ul>
